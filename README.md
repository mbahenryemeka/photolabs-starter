# react-photolabs
The PhotoLabs project was a key part of my Web Development React course programming. Through this project, I applied my knowledge of React to build a dynamic and interactive photo gallery application. It allowed me to put into practice concepts like state management, props, and hooks (useState, useEffect), making the learning process hands-on and engaging. Completing this project has given me a solid understanding of how React works in real-world scenarios.
